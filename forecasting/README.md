# Forecasting Project

# Brief Overview
This project uses Visa Spending Momentum Index data from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to demonstrate forecasting with ARIMA models.
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, sklearn
- Goal: Showcase a full ARIMA identification and application process

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ARIMA forecasting process using the Visa Spending Momentum Index from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to forecast the health of consumer spending and overall participation by consumers in economic trends. 

# Objectives
1. Explore time series data and visualization
2. Testing data for stationarity and performing necessary transformations
3. Selecting parameters using ACF/PACF
4. Model training using SARIMA
5. Generating forecast values and evalutation of effectiveness
6. Interpretation and communication of the results of the exercise
